This is getting easier . a win is a win
did some youtube code alongs
watched a couple hours of videos just to cement concepts and keystrokes. Feels good to get it more than ever. 

This web application is for movies... obviously. I .. understand.. what apis are for and i understand how they get into our code and where to put them. Just have to get familiar with typing(coding) everday. 
I already have adobe stock for my business so that was a help. Maybe ill make a background myself. ..
